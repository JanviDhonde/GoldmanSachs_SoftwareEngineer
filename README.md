# GoldmanSachs_SoftwareEngineer
I completed the **Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Job Simulation** on Forage, where I assessed IT security by cracking passwords with Hashcat and identified outdated hashing algorithms. I proposed improvements, including stronger password policies and better hashing methods, and documented my findings in a security memo.
