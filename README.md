## Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Job Simulation

**GoldmanSachs_SoftwareEngineer:** <br>
I completed the **Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Job Simulation** on Forage, where I assessed IT security by cracking passwords with Hashcat and identified outdated hashing algorithms. I proposed improvements, including stronger password policies and better hashing methods, and documented my findings in a security memo..

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository showcases my participation in the **Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on the Forage platform. The simulation allowed me to take on the role of a **governance analyst**, where I was responsible for assessing IT security, specifically focusing on password protection protocols within the organization. During this simulation, I developed hands-on experience in **cryptography**, **password cracking**, and enhancing **IT security practices**.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Password Cracking & Hashing Algorithm Analysis**  
   - Identified an outdated password hashing algorithm in use within the company. I utilized **Hashcat** to crack the passwords and assess the strength of the company's password protection practices.

2. **Proposing Security Improvements**  
   - After cracking the passwords, I proposed a series of **uplifts** to improve password protection, including extending the **minimum password length** and recommending the use of a more **dedicated hashing algorithm** for increased security.

3. **Writing a Security Memo**  
   - Wrote a **memo** summarizing my findings and the proposed improvements. This memo was meant to communicate the vulnerabilities in the current system and the necessary steps to mitigate potential security risks.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Cryptography Basics**: Applied fundamental concepts of **cryptography** to analyze password security practices and identify vulnerabilities in password storage systems.
- **Password Cracking**: Gained hands-on experience using **Hashcat** to crack passwords, which provided valuable insights into the strength of password hashing algorithms and their impact on security.
- **Password Best Practices**: Developed an understanding of **password best practices**, including the importance of using modern hashing algorithms and enforcing stronger password policies to prevent breaches.
- **Security Proposals**: Demonstrated the ability to propose actionable security improvements to address identified vulnerabilities, improving the overall security posture of an organization.
- **Technical Communication**: Enhanced my skills in **writing technical memos**, communicating complex security concepts to stakeholders in a clear and actionable format.

**Skills Developed:**
- **IT Security**: Deepened my understanding of **IT security** protocols and the critical role they play in protecting an organization’s sensitive information.
- **Security Vulnerability Identification**: Strengthened my ability to identify vulnerabilities in security practices and assess their potential impact on organizational security.
- **Governance Analysis**: Improved my ability to analyze and assess IT governance and security systems to ensure that they adhere to best practices and mitigate risks.

**Objective:**  
This repository documents the key tasks and skills I developed during the **Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Job Simulation**. I am eager to apply what I’ve learned about **cryptography**, **password protection**, and **IT security** to a **governance analyst** role at **Goldman Sachs** or another organization where I can contribute to improving security practices and reducing the risk of cyber threats.
